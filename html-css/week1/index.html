            In my free time, I enjoy getting away from the screen by playing softball. I play in an amateur league comprised of fellow web developers and software engineers. Each weekend, we organize games between competing companies. Once per year, we put together a charity fundraiser “World Series” event, which has raised over $70,000 in the last five years.
